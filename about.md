Hi! My name is Tristan White, I'm a _designer_, _developer_ and somewhat _unicorn-like._

I was born and raised in a small town in Denmark. Today I am proud to call myself a full-stack web developer. I've worked on projects like:

<ul>
    <li><a href="https://colordrop.io" tagert="_blank">colordrop.io</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://gridder.io" tagert="_blank">gridder.io</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://emilywhite.dk" tagert="_blank">emilywhite.dk</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://wordboss.de" tagert="_blank">wordboss.de</a></li>
    <!-- <li><a href="https://octodesk.dk" tagert="_blank">octodesk.dk</a></li> -->
</ul>

And many more...

I've also got tons of code examples over on [CodePen](https://codepen.io/triss90/) and 10's of coding videos over on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxnhnHu17q4Zk4m9-7BL5dw) and many more codeprojects on [GitHub](https://github.com/triss90)

As you can see, I love making beautiful, yet practical websites and applications and I would enjoy the opportunity to collaborate on your next project, so drop me an [email](mailto:oliver.tristan@gmail.com?subject=Hello%20Tristan) or a [tweet](https://twitter.com/Triss90) and lets get to work!
